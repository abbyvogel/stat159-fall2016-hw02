###### Abby Vogel

In this repository, you will find the directories /code, /data, /images, and /report as well as a makefile. 

The makefile of this repository generates or downloads files in the /images and /data directories. Additionally, the makefile generates a PDF of the report.Rmd using non-interactive Rscript. 

Special thank you to [stackoverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/) and [http://kbroman.org/](http://kbroman.org/) for troubleshooting.
